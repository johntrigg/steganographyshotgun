# Overview
Hello! This is a tool designed to help with steganography tools in CTFs. There are a lot of tools to steganography, and it's tricky to remember all of them, so I figured I'd make a tool to help with this.

# How does it work?
You feed it a file, and the filetype, and it'll run relevant tools on it. For example, you cannot run ztseg on a jpg file.
